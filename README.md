# ch57x-keyboard-tool Macro Keyboard Configuration Utility

![Last Commit Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool?style=for-the-badge) ![Release Workflow Badge](https://github.com/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

## What is this?

This is a utility for programming small keyboards like this one:

![Picture of keyboard-12-2](doc/keyboard-12-2.png)

Such macro keyboards are popular on AliExpress and sellers usually send software for programming, but it:
* requires Windows
* is very ugly and inconvenient
* can only program one key at a time
* don't expose all keyboard features

There are several modifications of such keyboards with different numbers of buttons and knobs (See the [photos of supported keyboards](#photos-of-supported-keyboards)) and with/without Bluetooth.

Both wired and wireless keyboards are supported.  
‚ö†Ô∏è However, the keyboard must be connected to the computer with the USB cable when programming it.

### Supported keyboards

This utility was reported to work with:
* 3√ó4 with 2 knobs (Bluetooth version)
* 3√ó3 with 2 knobs
* 3x2 with 1 knob
* 3x1 with 1 knob (but [read about it's limitations](#3x1-keys--1-knob-keyboard-limitations))

All these keyboards share the same vendor/product IDs: `1189:8890` (hexadecimal).
It is possible to override used vendor/product ID, but it is usually not needed.
Use it only if you find same-looking keyboard with other vendor/product ID,
I haven't seen such.

Refer to the [Supported Macro Keyboards](#supported-macro-keyboards) section for more details.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Ability to override vendor/product ID doesn't mean that you can use this software for programming arbitrary keyboards!**

## Installation

There are two ways to get this software: prebuilt release or build it yourself.

### Get prebuilt release

Download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/kriomant/ch57x-keyboard-tool/releases)

### Build it yourself

1. Install the *cargo* utility using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
    * Brew: `brew install rustup-init && rustup-init`
    * Linux: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
    * Windows: download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/)
1. Execute `cargo install ch57x-keyboard-tool`.

## Usage

**Note**: Windows users need to install [USBDK](https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk/releases) first.

1. Connect the keyboard to the computer with the USB cable.
1. Create a configuration file based on the provided [example-mapping.yaml](example-mapping.yaml).
    * Example config has extensive documentation and examples inside.
1. Validate the configuration file.
1. Upload the configuration to the keyboard.
1. Done! üéâ

### List all supported modifiers and key names

Use 'show-keys' command to list all supported modifiers and key names.

```shell
./ch57x-keyboard-tool show-keys
```

### Validate the config file

```shell
./ch57x-keyboard-tool validate < your-config.yaml
```

### Upload the config to the keyboard

```shell
./ch57x-keyboard-tool upload < your-config.yaml
```

Use 'sudo' if you get 'Access denied (insufficient permissions)':

```shell
sudo ./ch57x-keyboard-tool upload < your-config.yaml
```

### Change led configuration

If your keyboard supports it, you can change the LED configuration:

```shell
./ch57x-keyboard-tool led 1
```

### Windows / PowerShell

Use `Get-Content` for input redirection:

```shell
Get-Content your-config.yaml | ./ch57x-keyboard-tool validate
```

## Automation

A common question/requests are about automation such as "How to run a script?", "emulate several keys", or "how to trigger an action with a key press?"

This tool does just one job: **writes your key bindings into a keyboard** and then exists.  
It does not listen for key presses.
Automation based on key presses is not in the scope of this utility tool.

If you want any automation, use third-party automation tools, like [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/).

1. Choose some chord you do not usually use, like `alt-ctrl-shift-1` and assign it to a key
2. Use a third-party tool to listen for this chord and perform the desired action
3. Done! üéâ

## Notes

### Number of layers

All keyboards I've seen have three layer (three keys configuration which
may be switched). However I've been told there are keyboards without
layer switch. If so, just keep single layer in configuration file and you
are done.

### Custom keyboard layouts

If you use custom keyboard layout, like Dvorak, note that what you
write in configuration is in fact scan code of keyboard key and not
character that will be produced.

So use QWERTY-letter of keyboard key you want to press.

### 3x1 keys + 1 knob keyboard limitations

This modification does support key modifiers (like ctrl-, alt-) for the first key in sequence only.

So you can use: `ctrl-alt-del,1,2`, but not `ctrl-alt-del,alt-1,2`.

## Diagnostics

When reporting an issue, please include diagnostics such as the list of attached USB devices and the output of the `keyboard` and `mouse` monitoring tools.

### How to find and list connected usb devices

#### macOS

```shell
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
```

or

```shell
ioreg -w0 -l -p IOUSB
```

#### Linux

```shell
lsusb -v
```

#### Windows

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object { $_.Class -eq 'USB' } | Format-Table Name, DeviceID, Manufacturer, Status, Description -AutoSize
```

### Monitoring generated keyboard and mouse events

The most simple (and cross-platform) way I have found is using `keyboard` and `mouse` Python modules.

Monitoring keyboard:

```shell
pip3 install keyboard
sudo python3 -m keyboard
```

Monitoring mouse:
* The latest published 'mouse' module doesn't support macOS, so use the latest version from GitHub

```shell
git clone https://github.com/boppreh/mouse
cd mouse
python3 -m mouse
```
